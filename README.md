# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

With a solid foundation of four years as a psychological counselor, I embraced a transformative journey into the world of software development, achieving remarkable growth in just three years. My unique background empowers me to approach challenges with a fresh perspective, blending analytical skills with creativity to craft impactful solutions.

I'm a passionate developer who began with PHP and has since expanded into the dynamic world of JavaScript frameworks. I'm currently building projects with React, Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js, and I'm continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible with these technologies.

Whether it's creating intuitive front-end experiences or architecting robust back-end systems, I'm always eager to collaborate on meaningful projects that make a difference. Letâ€™s connect and turn innovative ideas into reality!

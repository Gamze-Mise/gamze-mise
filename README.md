# About Me

👋 Hello and welcome!

After several years working as a psychological counselor, I transitioned into software development and have been actively building products for the past few years. This unique background helps me approach engineering problems with empathy, analysis, and creative problem solving.

I started out with PHP and JavaScript, and over time expanded into modern JavaScript frameworks and backend tools. I enjoy building intuitive front-end experiences and reliable back-end services, and I’m continuously improving my skills through real projects.

Currently I work with **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**, and I’m always open to collaborations on meaningful projects.
